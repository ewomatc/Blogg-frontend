Layout and Pages
inside components, we have a mainlayout.jsx file. This file acts as the template/layout for every page that comes with the header and footer, the main content/components for the individual pages are then passed in as 'children' props
we import this mainlayout.jsx inside the homepage.jsx, the homepage.jsx is for the landing page, this page is returned inside App.jsx as the first component. 

Inside pages folder, we have created a folder named 'home', this home folder contains the homepage.jsx, and a container folder that contains the individual components for our homepage, inside the container folder we create our first child component, the 'Hero' component, and we pass this hero component as a child 'in between the Mainlayout tag' in out Homepage. 

***because we used the 'children' props in main layout, whatevr is passed in between mainlayout  tag will appear in between header and footer


<App.jsx>
  <Homepage>
    <Mainlayout  ----> (Header and footer)>
      <Hero/>
    <Mainlayout/>
  <Homepage/>
<App.jsx/>
